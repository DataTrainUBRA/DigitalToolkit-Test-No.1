As part of the Data Train program by the U Bremen Research Alliance, a curated digital learning catalog - the “Digital Toolkit” is being developed.
The aim of the Digital Toolkit is to provide a central, freely accessible, high-quality collection of selected digital self-learning materials that both complement the existing Data Train courses and enable independent, flexible, and needs-based online learning in the fields of data science, research data management, and digital methods.
