## **Digital Tool Kit**

As part of the Data Train program by the U Bremen Research Alliance, a curated digital learning catalog - the “Digital Toolkit” is being developed.
The aim of the Digital Toolkit is to provide a central, freely accessible, high-quality collection of selected digital self-learning materials that both complement the existing Data Train courses and enable independent, flexible, and needs-based online learning in the fields of data science, research data management, and digital methods.

### **Why?**

1. Lecturers have limited time
2. Learners often don’t know where and how to start learning
3. Learners also don’t know what are good and right materials to work with

**We would like to provide fewer but better resources**
- Those can be used structured and at own’s discretion
- Easy to find, easy to use and open access


##  **Data Train**

The Data Train Program is designed to equip early-career researchers and students with essential skills in research data management and data science. The program is divided into multiple “tracks” to accommodate a variety of learning needs.

## **University of Bremen Research Alliance**

The University of Bremen and twelve federal and state financed non-university research institutes cooperate within the U Bremen Research Alliance. The Alliance includes research institutes of the four major German science organizations, i.e. Fraunhofer Society, Helmholtz Association, Leibniz Association and Max Planck Society, as well as the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence.

The cooperation in the U Bremen Research Alliance extends over the four scientific High-Profile Areas “Marine, Polar and Climate Research”, “Material Sciences and Production Engineering”, “Health Sciences” and “Minds, Media, Machines” and thus literally “From deep sea to outer space".
